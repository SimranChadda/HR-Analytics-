# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
This is a real-time challenge coming from HR Pinali Mandalia and founder Dhaval Patel from AtliQ Technologies.

# Project Goal
The job was to create a dashboard in Power BI that could analyze 3 months of data to help HR automate tasks instead of manually going through attendance spreadsheets for hours.

# Requirements from HR

* Working preferences of employees between Working from Home and Working from Office.
* Finding the percentage of overall sick leave to understand and monitor employee wellness.
* The reason behind choice of work from home or work from office.
* And lastly, to make Pinali understand the basics of Power BI through this project.

# Benefits
* If she gets these insights from the data, let's say, most employees are doing WFH on Friday and Monday then on the remaining days, can be planned for some team-building activities or team lunches when the majority of presence is there in the company.
* The other benefit of getting these insights, just that if the company is going for the Hybrid Model working ( Ex- WFH 2 days, WFO 3 days), then she can do better capacity planning.
* Also, the company can have better utilization of space and saves some cost on infrastructure after getting these types of insights.

# About the Dashboard
The Dashboard provides Presence Insights of the employees. 
1. Developed a Dashboard for Presence, Work From Home, and Sick Leave of the employees of AtliQ Technologies.
2. The analysis is done on various parameters to give a proper insight into the requirements mentioned by HR.

# Data Source

* Total Present %
* WFH Count
* WFH%
* Sick Leave Count
* Sick Leave %
* Leave Days
* Leave Days %

Dax Functions used-
DIVIDE, CALCULATE,  VAR, COUNTROWS, IN, RETURN, SUM, NOT, SWITCH, FORMAT,
